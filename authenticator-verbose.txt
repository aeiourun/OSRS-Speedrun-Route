Introduction
    Welcome to the wonderful world of Oldschool RuneScape speedrunning.

Setup
    Each run is started with a new account, with the email address authenticated, and the authenticator set up.
    However, only one email address is needed to make any number of RuneScape accounts.
    Create the email address you want to use for this.
    It is recommended that you setup a short and memorable gmail account "usernamerun@gmail.com".
    When setting up the runescape account, you can use the email "usernamerun+1@gmail.com", and increment it by one each run.
    Your runescape login will be "usernamerun+1@gmail.com" and the authentication email will go to "usernamerun@gmail.com".
    Make a new oldschool runescape account.
    Go to the main oldschool page and click enable authenticator.
    Open google authenticator on your phone and scan the code.
    Enter the code on the web page to enable authenticator.
    Log in on the client and enter the authenticator code.

General Running Knowledge
    If you log in to a new account, log out without finishing character creation, then log back in:
        You will no longer have the character creation screen, and the run is considered started here.
    
    The first time you change world with an authenticator account you will be brought back to the authenticator verification.
        Hit cancel, and then enter your username and password again.

    Hold spacebar through all dialog.
    
    Run depletes faster the more weight you are carrying.
    Stockpile run energy while carrying a heavy load, and run when you have a light load.
    
    Always be in motion. Click doors and be walking on the next game tick. Stay prepared for your next action.
    
    The openness of the game means there are a huge number of backup strats available to a runner.
    Much of this run was built from strats discovered on the fly after something went wrong.
    As it is in life, there are no mistakes. Only "happy little accidents".
