#### Files

**authenticator-verbose.txt:** Complete route notes. Recommended for learning the route.

**authenticator-basic.txt:** Bare bones route notes. Technically contains all information needed for a run, but not for the uninitiated.

 **old-route.txt:** Deprecated route notes. Outdated, but neat.
