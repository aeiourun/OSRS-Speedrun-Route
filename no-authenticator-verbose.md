# Champions Guild No Authenticator Route (Verbose)

## Notes

### Introduction
These are the verbose notes for the F2P Champions' Guild Ironman category. The goal of this category is to enter the champions guild, which requires 32 quest points. This route is currently the fastest known route, and was the culmination of a lot of work by the OSRS speedrunning community - with special notice to crasset.

Please see the README.md file for complete speedrunning introduction information and links.

### Rules
Timing starts upon clicking "Accept" on the character creation screen on Tutorial Island. 
Timing ends upon entering the Champions guild, which requires 32 quest points. 
- Must be an Ironman account.
- The account must not log in to a Members' only world during the run. 
- Skippy is not allowed. 
- Timing must be RTA. 
- Mouse cursor must be visible.
- Must use the official game client.
- Multilogging is allowed, but must be noted with submission of the run.
	- If multilogging is used the run will be marked as using it on the leaderboard.

(Multilogging is any other account having a direct effect on the run that the runner could control, I.E. Manipulating NPCs on an alt account, or picking up the ashes from another player's fire.)

### Terms
**[BANK]**: Deposit all inventory and worn items, withdraw the listed items.

**[Split]**: Commonly used split locations.

### Setup
Each run is started with a brand new account, each account news a unique email address.

However there is a trick to only require the creation of one email address for all of your accounts.

Create a new email address, it is recommended that you setup a short and memorable gmail account "usernamerun@gmail.com".

You can then use the email "usernamerun+1@gmail.com", and increment it by one each run.

Your runescape login will be "usernamerun+1@gmail.com" and the authentication email will go to "usernamerun@gmail.com".

Accounts do not need to be authenticated for this route, and this should be the only work you need to do before logging in.

### General Running Knowledge
If you log in to a new account, log out without finishing character creation, then log back in - You will no longer have the character creation screen, and the run is considered started here.

Hold spacebar through all dialogue.

Use number keys for all dialogue.
    
Run depletes faster the more weight you are carrying.  Stockpile run energy while carrying a heavy load, and run when you have a light load.
    
Always be in motion. Click doors and be walking on the next game tick. Stay prepared for your next action.
    
The openness of the game means there are a huge number of backup strats available to a runner. Much of this run was built from strats discovered on the fly after something went wrong. As it is in life, there are no mistakes. Only "happy little accidents".
