# Black Knights' Fortress Ultimate Ironman (Verbose)

## Notes

### Introduction
These are the verbose notes for the F2P Ultimate Ironman Black Knights' Fortress category. The goal of this category is to complete Black Knights' Fortress, which requires 12 quest points. The majority of this was routed by TheDarkestUno.

This category is a good choice if you want an easier run than Champions' Guild, as there is very little multitasking to mess up and the run is less than half as long.

Please see the README.md file for complete speedrunning introduction information and links.
